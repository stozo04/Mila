												<p>
													Today you turned 1 Year 3 Months.
												</p>

												<p>
													As I sit here reflecting on the past month, I’m filled with awe at just how 
													much you've grown, Mila. It's incredible how every day brings a new adventure,
													a new discovery. At 15 months, you’re not just taking a few steps anymore — you're
													walking everywhere! Watching you confidently explore the world around you has been 
													one of the greatest joys for me.
												</p>
												<p>
													I remember when we took you to the park this month, and for the first time, you were able to walk around on your own and truly explore. 
													The sun was shining, and the grass seemed so tall next to your tiny feet. You didn’t hesitate to let go of our hands and wander off, 
													your face lighting up with excitement as you toddled across the playground, completely in your element. 
													It's as if you’ve unlocked a whole new way of experiencing the world, and seeing you explore with such confidence fills me with pride. 
													Each step you take feels like a beautiful new adventure.
												</p>
												<p>
													But that’s not the only milestone that’s made this month special. After what felt like such a long battle with your cough, you’re finally feeling better.
													Your whooping cough was such a challenge for all of us. Hearing you cough and struggle through the nights broke my heart, but here we are, breathing easier—literally! 
													And can I just say, we are all so happy to be getting a full night’s sleep again. The doctor was right; time and care have worked wonders. 
													Now, your giggles have replaced those coughs, and life feels a little bit lighter.
												</p>
												<p>
													Speaking of giggles, bath time has become your absolute favorite! Every evening, as soon as you hear the water running, you can’t help but bounce with excitement. 
													Watching you splash around and laugh in pure delight fills me with the kind of happiness that’s hard to put into words. It’s these simple moments—when you’re carefree 
													and playing—that make every day so special.
												</p>
												<p>
													This month, you've also become quite the little helper. You’ve taken it upon yourself to help feed "aff aff". Seeing you learning to scoop his food into the bowl with such determination
													is both hilarious and heartwarming. You're learning so quickly, and your eagerness to be involved in everyday tasks is truly amazing.
												</p>
												<p>
													Another new favorite of yours is your little drawing table. We set it up with crayons and markers, and you love to scribble away, lost in your own little world of creativity. 
													It’s so fun to watch your tiny hands work, as if you already have so much to say through your drawings.
												</p>
												<p>
													And let’s not forget how much your understanding has grown. You’re learning new words every day and following simple commands like a pro. 
													The other day, I dropped something and asked you to pick it up for me—and you did it! It’s these small acts of communication that show just how much you’re soaking up from the world around you. 
													You’re growing, learning, and showing us new sides of yourself every day.
												</p>
												<p>
													As I wrap up this reflection, I can’t help but feel a mix of pride and nostalgia. With each new step you take—whether it's walking across the park, feeding our dog, 
													or learning new words—you’re moving further into your own little world. But no matter how far you go, we’ll always be right here, cheering you on, ready to catch you if you ever stumble. 
													I love you more than words can say, Mila, and we can’t wait to see what next month brings.
												</p>
												
												<p>
													With all the love in the world,
												</p>
												<p>
													Your Papa
