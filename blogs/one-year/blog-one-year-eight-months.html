												<h5>Russian Christmas, Snow Days and Growing Vocabulary</h6>

												<p>Mila, my sweet girl, this month has been a whirlwind of joy, learning, and a few tough moments. From celebrating Russian traditions to discovering the magic of snow, every day with you has been full of wonder. Even in the difficult times, your resilience shines through, and I couldn’t be prouder of you.</p>
												
												<h2 class="highlight">Russian Christmas & New Year’s Celebration <span class="emoji">🎄🎁</span></h2>
												
												<p>This year, we rang in the New Year by celebrating Russian Christmas with Mama’s family! It was a beautiful tradition that I hope you love as much as I do! You were completely spoiled with amazing presents. Your little face lit up with every gift you unwrapped, and the joy in the room was undeniable. Seeing you embrace these family traditions makes my heart so full, and I can’t wait for you to grow up cherishing these special moments.</p>

												<h2 class="highlight">Snow Day Fun! <span class="emoji">❄️☃️</span></h2>
												
												<p>Mila, you got to experience a real snow day! It snowed for a few days, and your school even got canceled. We all stayed at Baba's house and braved the snowstorm together. We tried to get you to go play outside with Liza and Bella, but you were having none of it! The cold was not your thing, and instead of running around in the snow, you clung to us as tightly as possible to stay warm. It was the sweetest thing seeing you snuggle up, knowing exactly what you needed—warmth, comfort, and lots of cuddles!</p>
												
												<h2 class="highlight">A Blanket-Loving Snugglebug <span class="emoji">🛏️❤️</span></h2>
												
												<p>One of the sweetest things you’ve started doing is finally loving your blanket! You used to push it away, but now you adore being tucked in, all cozy and warm. Every night, we wrap you up snugly, and you drift off so peacefully. It’s such a small thing, but to us, it’s another sign that you’re growing up and finding comfort in new ways.</p>
												
												<h2 class="highlight">Your Words Are Growing! <span class="emoji">🗣️📚</span></h2>
												
												<p>Mila, your vocabulary is exploding, and it’s the most exciting thing to watch! Your favorite new words are “there” and “no”—which, let’s be honest, you say quite a lot now! But the most incredible part? You’re starting to recognize so many words in your books! You can point out “dog,” “hat,” and even “snowman.” Every time you correctly spot a word, I can’t help but beam with pride. You are getting so smart, and watching you learn makes every day even more special.</p>
												
												<h2 class="highlight">A Trip to the Dallas Arboretum <span class="emoji">🐆🦉</span></h2>
												
												<p>We took you to the Dallas Arboretum this month, and oh, Mila, you absolutely fell in love with the baby leopard! Your little eyes were glued to it, and you were completely mesmerized. Meanwhile, I couldn’t stop watching the owls—they were fascinating! It’s amazing to see how we each find our own favorite things, even in the same experience. This day will always be a special memory for me.</p>
												
												<h2 class="highlight">Helping Cousin Brooke <span class="emoji">🚚</span></h2>

												<p>Your cousin Brooke moved to Dallas after graduating from Texas Tech, and you helped her move in! You were so good at making sure everyone was working together, and we capped off the day with a fun dinner celebration. It was a lovely reminder of how family makes every moment even more special.</p>												
				
												<h2 class="highlight">A Tough Sickness & Missed Picture Day <span class="emoji">🤒📸</span></h2>
												
												<p>Unfortunately, on the very day you turned 1 year and 8 months, you caught a really bad sickness. It was also supposed to be your school picture day, which made me extra sad that we missed it. Seeing you unwell was so tough, but even through it all, you stayed strong. And as I write this, you are already feeling so much better, bouncing back with that unstoppable energy of yours.</p>
												
												<hr>
												
												<p>Mila, this month has been a mix of joy, growth, and challenges, but through it all, you continue to amaze us. You are learning so much, discovering new things every day, and filling our lives with love. No matter what, we will always be here—cheering you on, tucking you in, and loving you more than words can say. ❤️</p>
												
												<p>As we wrap up this month, remember that every moment—whether filled with joy or a bit of sadness—helps you grow into the wonderful person you are becoming. We’ll always be here, cheering you on through every adventure.</p>
												
												<p>
													With all the love in the world,
												</p>
												<p>
													Your Papa
