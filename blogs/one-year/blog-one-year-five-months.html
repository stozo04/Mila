												<h1>Zoo, Hayrides, Arboretum and Halloween</h1>

												<p>As you turned 17 months, Mila, this month overflowed with adventure and moments that brought smiles to all our faces. 
													Every day seemed to hold something new, and you embraced each experience with such wonder that it‚Äôs hard for us to believe 
													just how fast you‚Äôre growing.</p>
											
												<h2 class="highlight">A Wild Day at the Zoo <span class="emoji">üêí</span></h2>
											
												<p>We kicked off this month with a special outing. –¢—ë—Ç—è –ê—Å—Ç—è, Liza, and Bella took you on your very first trip to the zoo! 
													It was a day filled with awe, as you got to see so many animals for the first time. 
													And oh, how your eyes lit up when we arrived at the monkey enclosure! You couldn‚Äôt get enough of them. 
													You were mesmerized by a monkey statue you would not stop giving it sweet little kisses. 
													Your love for the monkeys was infectious‚Äîit was like watching pure joy in action. 
													Moments like these remind me of the simple and genuine way you experience the world.</p>
											
												<h2 class="highlight">Your First Hayride <span class="emoji">üéÉ</span></h2>
											
												<p>This month was also full of autumn delights! We took you to a local farm for your first hayride. 
													 We saw even more animals, and you seemed so curious, reaching out and trying to pet a few of the pigs and goats.
													  With the whole family there, it was a day of creating memories together, the kind of memories that feel woven with warmth.</p>
											
												<h2 class="highlight">Nana D, PawPaw, and a Surprise Party <span class="emoji">üéâ</span></h2>
											
												<p>We were thrilled when Nana D and PawPaw came into town for a weekend visit. 
													It was the perfect opportunity to celebrate Mama‚Äôs birthday with a surprise party!
													 You joined right in, clapping your hands and sharing that big smile of yours with everyone. 
													 And while they were here, we took a special trip to the Dallas Arboretum, where you saw thousands and thousands of pumpkins! 
													 Over 100,000 pumpkins filled the gardens, as we explored every pumpkin-lined pathway together.</p>
											
												<h2 class="highlight">Halloween Duckling <span class="emoji">ü¶Üüç¨</span></h2>
											
												<p>Your second Halloween was truly a memory to keep. You went trick-or-treating for the very first time as the cutest little baby duck 
													anyone has ever seen. Watching you waddle from door to door in your fluffy costume, holding out your tiny hands for candy, melted my heart.
													 And you even knew what you wanted! Your little fingers pointed straight to the treats that caught your eye, 
													 and you managed to charm everyone with those big eyes and feathered costume. You were so proud, and I was so proud of you.</p>
											
												<h2 class="highlight">Moving Up: A New Class at School <span class="emoji">üéí</span></h2>
											
												<p>Amidst all the fun, you‚Äôve reached another milestone‚Äîyou graduated to a new class at school! 
													They told us you‚Äôre ready for the next stage, and as much as it tugs at my heart, I know this is part of your journey. 
													You‚Äôre growing up so quickly, learning so much each day, and I‚Äôm in awe of the person you‚Äôre becoming.</p>
											
												<p></p>
												<p>As you continue to grow and discover the world, know that we‚Äôre here to cheer you on, to share in your laughter, 
													and to help you through every little step. We love you so much, Mila, and these adventures‚Äîbig and small‚Äîare only the beginning
													 of all the magic that life has in store for you.</p>
												
												<p>
													With all the love in the world,
												</p>
												<p>
													Your Papa
